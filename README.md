## Overview
We are replicating Osu!, in which the main goal of the game is to hit the objects at the right moment in order to earn points. The amount of points awarded varies depending on the time at which the user hits the “real” object, in relation to the “approaching” object; the player should try to hit the object at the exact moment in which the approaching object shrinks to the size of the real object (traditionally, these objects are circles). The closer the timing, the higher amount of points awarded. Where we break off, however, is in our plan to implement bomb objects, as well as attaching individual notes to each object rather than playing a song.
## Instructions
Select a map to play. Gain points by interacting with the circle, slider, and spinner objects. For the circles, click on the circle when the outer circle is close to approaching the inner one. The closer they are to overlapping when you click it, the more points you  gain. For the  sliders, press and hold the circle, following its path. The longer you stay pressing the traveling circle, the more points you rack up. Lastly, for the spinners, spin around the center of the circle as many times as you can within a certain time duration. The more revolutions, the more points. Build a song with your hits! Map 1 contains only circle objects, Map 2 incorporates circles and sliders, and Map 3 incorporates all three objects.
NOTE: import Sound and Minim libraries before running the program!
