## Overview
We are replicating Osu!, in which the main goal of the game is to hit the objects at the right moment in order to earn points. The amount of points awarded varies depending on the time at which the user hits the “real” object, in relation to the “approaching” object; the player should try to hit the object at the exact moment in which the approaching object shrinks to the size of the real object (traditionally, these objects are circles). The closer the timing, the higher amount of points awarded. Where we break off, however, is in our plan to implement bomb objects, as well as attaching individual notes to each object rather than playing a song.
